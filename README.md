# Give Your All #
Developed from an interest in charity, this app lets a user search for charities and causes to make donations. It accesses a charity API, and collates and tracks user donations. Only the user and site administrator may access the user’s data. The app can be connected to Stripe or another financial technology tools. The app's administrator can collect donations to forward onto nominated charities. This intermediary provides anonymity to the user/donor.

## Get Started ##
[Give Your All](http://giveyourall.herokuapp.com "GiveYourAll")<br>
[Trello](https://trello.com/b/eaIztHJ3/giveyourall "Trello")<br>
**1.** Create an account using a name, password, and email address.<br>
**2.** Search the API for a list of charities to donate to. Charity details include the name, rating, cause and mission, along with a direct URL for the organization.<br>
**3.** Select a charity to add to a donation‐package list. Charities may also be deleted from the package before finalizing.<br>
**4.** Adjust the amount of funds to be sent to the charity. <br>
**5.** Create a donation by finalizing the package of charities and amounts.<br>
**6.** Look up donation records; each shows info related to the donation package: donation id, amount donated, and date.<br>

## Next Steps ##
**•** Improve mobile‐friendly design (largely by CSS).<br>
**•** Edit the donation packages in the user's record, treating the donation package as a subscription model.<br>
**•** Add a secondary "one‐shot" donation option to follow the subscription‐adjustment.<br>
**•** Add a second API which to randomly display an inspirational quote in or above the navbar, based on <br>giving, charity, and similar positive philosophies.<br>
