# Give Your All
Coincidentally developed near the end-of-year holidays, this app provides the ability to search for charities and causes to make donations by accessing a charity APIâ€”providing anonymity in giving by working through an intermediary and thus avoiding all those pesky emails, texts, calls, and letters.

# Getting Started

[Give Your All](http://giveyourall.herokuapp.com "GiveYourAll")<br>
[Trello](https://trello.com/b/eaIztHJ3/giveyourall "Trello")<br>

1. Upon visiting the site, the user is able to create an account using a name, email address, and password.

2. The user is then able to log in, where they can search the API for a list of charities to donate to. Charity details include the name, rating, cause and mission, along with a URL for the organization.

3. The user can then choose to add a charity to a donation-package list, and adjust the amount of funds to be sent to the charity. Charities can also be deleted from the package before it is finalized.

4. After finalizing the order, the user can also look up their own donation records, each listing info on the package: the id, amount donated, and date.

# Next Steps

1. Edit the donation packages in the user's record, treating the donation package as a subscription model.

2. Add a secondary "one-shot" donation option to follow the subscription-adjustment.

3. Add a second API which will randomly display an inspirational quote based on giving, charity, and similar principles.

4. Improve mobile-friendly design (largely by CSS).
